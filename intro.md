#Introduction to Dragonchain

Dragonchain is an exciting new opensource blockchain. The code exists on [github](https://github.com/dragonchain/dragonchain), and it provides an amazing toolkit for building your own blockchain based on your needs.

The Dragonchain project was originally developed at the Seattle Office of the Walt Disney Company, and it was open sourced [link](https://disney.github.io). The Dragonchain Foundation [link](https://dragonchain.github.io) manages the open source project. A company called Dragonchain [link](http://dragonchain.com) did an ICO in the winter of 2017, to fund further development of the project. 

#Dragonchain Goals 
Dragonchain was developed to handle the needs of organizations and developers. Which has caused it to diverge from the orthadoxy that that has driven many of the decisions that exist in both Bitcoin and Etherum. That said, it elegently interops with the public blockchains when that integration is desired. 

Dragonchain was developed to meet business needs and goals. Which lead to four design decisions that are a bit different than the usual with Blockchain based applications. First is the ability to build hybrid proof of stake /proof of work systems. Second is the strong integration with web based systems. Protection of business data. And lastly fixed blocks based on time. I'm going to briefly go into each one of those design decisions and explain what that means to a developer.
