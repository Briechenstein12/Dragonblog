# Introduction to Smart Contracts

Now we get into the exciting stuff. All of the things we have seen Dragonchain do before have been things that are old hat to any user of a database backed web service. 

When I was a youngster I read Snow Crash by Neal Stephenson, and his vivid descriptions of cyberspace and how it interacted with the physical world lit a fire in my imagination. His Hiro Protagonist, uses computers to spin up companies and manipulate the legal and physical world in intersting ways. I feel that Blockchain technology + Smart Contracts is the first step toward bringing those imaginings of Stphenson into our world. 

So what is a Smart Contract? A smart contract is a computer program that runs on the data in a blockchain. As you might remember, data on a blockchain has been agreed to be real from either from a Proof-of-Work concensus, or a Proof-of-Stake concensus. And a Smart Contract has the ability to take that data, and perform actions based on the agreed true data. And becuse the program is published on the blockchain and is crypotographically signed... No one can alter it, without all of the parties involved being able to see the modification. 

Lets get cracking on writing our first Dragonchain smart contract.
